# Main Features
- Upstreamed 4.4.264 merged
- Latest CAF tag and wifi stack merged for msm8998
  - LA.UM.8.4.c25-00600-8x98.0
- Built with latest LLVM Clang 13 from LLVM's apt repository for Debian
  - ThinLTO, LD-DCDE, and -O3 Enabled
- Dynamic SchedTune Structure
  - Dynamically sets values according to interactivity with durations preconfigured, check lazy_defconfig
    in source code to see the values.
  - Can be modified through any kernel manager by changing dynamic_boost value, a parameter part of the
    schedtune structure.
  - Makes use of PM QoS to assist with task placement and improve overall system performance.
- New schedtune parameter - 'boost_bias'
  - This separately enables the bias that comes with boosting tasks. This is equivalent to enabling boost
    which allows the scheduler to just prefer big cluster cpus without increasing the utilization of the
    tasks in the said cgroup.
- Sultan's msm8998 efficient CPU frequency table
- Flar2's adrenoboost / GPU boost with DynStune integration
- Modified Simple Low Memory Killer by Sultan
- ARM's Power Allocator Thermal Governor
- Sound driver modifications (Hardcoded)
  - Forced CLS_AB RX HPH Mode (except for telephony)
    - Also reconfigured CLS_AB HPH and gain path to match CLS_AB_HIFI implementation
    - Removed low-power configuration (xvlad113x and Yaroslav Furman)
  - 0.8 DAC gain
  - 24bit rx format for all slim_rx output (speaker and line-out outputs)
  - Turned on MSM HiFi control
  - Forced low latency audio through device tree props
  - Set custom ASM msm audio effect values and process the topology in 24bit
  - Switched on Native SampleRate and Bit Width mode
  - Removed headphone gain control (does not support the modifications due to the
    changing of gain source)
  - MSM ADM Override
    - Pushes values to EC reference and native mode for RX outputs to improve sound quality
- BBRv1 + FQ_CODEL TCP setup
- CFS modifications to improve task placement
- Rewritten Flicker free (DC Dimming) driver with improvements
- Updated Wireguard to version 20201221
- Notification LED control by Lord Boeffla
- Fsync Switch by franciscofranco
- USB fast charge mode by engstk
- Uses Firmware MAC address (same as stock OOS MAC address) by prioritizing
  FW-provided MAC address instead of wlan_mac.bin or platform driver
- Allow CPU frequency minimum scaling
- Selected memory management modifications from tytydraco
- Removed CPU input boost and Devfreq boost
- Disabled Userspace boosting
- Disabled more debugging codes as much as possible
- Fixed code errors / warnings pointed out by compiler
- Includes all other features the base kernel provides (F2FS, Wireguard, etc.)
- and more minor stuff...
